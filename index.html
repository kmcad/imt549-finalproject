        This cookbook has been years in the making. What started out as a
        “simple” project of gathering all of our various families’ recipes
        turned into a fun but labor-intensive journey through the stories and
        histories we’ve all shared at the dining room table. Over the course of
        about 24 months, I have made all but a handful of the recipes in this
        cookbook. At first, I wanted to make sure I had pictures of every dish
        because I hate opening a cookbook and finding a wall of text, but no
        image of what the finished product will look like. Even with something
        that is straightforward, I think pictures make the recipe infinitely
        more enticing. As I kept going, I found that making each recipe made me
        better understand the possible challenges each might present. I’d like
        to share the stories, pictures, and recipes with all of you in a virtual
        index that connects the dishes to the family members who contributed
        them, almost like a virtual potluck.
