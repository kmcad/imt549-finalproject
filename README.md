## Description of project

I'm creating a website to house a collection of recipes for my family. I've been working over the past year and a half to collect, cook, and write stories for recipes from the various sides of my family. Though the physical print book will be organized by dish type, this website will be organized by contributor. It will be a fun way for my family to browse recipes through a different format.
